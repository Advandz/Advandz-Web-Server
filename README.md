#### Apache
We decided to implement Apache to give the maximum compatibility with all the actual products on the market, but we know that is not the best server in terms of performance, due to this we have developed Advandz Web Server, that includes an Apache booster that use an integration of NGINX and Varnish that caches both the static and dynamic contents which help the web server to serve the content from the cache every time it is requested.
